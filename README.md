## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is so i may practice using git and github with out having to upload any bad code.

## Objectives

- Get comfortable using git in all new projects.
- Getting to know how to make new branches and merge them
- Write clear commits
- Fork a project you like, make your own changes.
- Learn more on md format
- try to use ssh keys

## Study from where?
Most of my studies for now are coming from the book [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

I have tried other methods as to watching youtube videos or short online tutorials. Personally they havent been helping me as much as this book is right now. Thank you Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

## Goals For the Future
I hope to actually use git effectively. And that I may contribute to some open source projects.
